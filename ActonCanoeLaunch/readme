Eventually, this will be parameterized & scripted, so that all or any of the maps can udpated easily. 
But here's a prototype, to explore what's doable in creating maps for a guidebook and the website. 

getmap.sh - fetches the basic map from mapbox
legend.sh - builds the legend
guidebook.sh - assembles the guidebook version 

later: scale.sh to build the scale
webpdf: build the 8.5 X 11 PDF for the website that includes a title.
